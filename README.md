## ⚔️ FACTIONS DOSSIER

Your survival depends on your loyalties. Choose wisely.

### 🛡️ ROYAL PROTECTION FORCE (RPF)
*Remnants of the old world order, fighting to restore the Crown's authority.*

*   **The Regiment** *(Assault)*: Drawn from the SAS and Pathfinders. The tip of the spear. Professional, cynical, and ruthlessly efficient hunter-killers.
*   **The Officers** *(Heavy)*: Former CTSFO units from Oakhaven Constabulary. Hardened by betrayal, they have become a hardened, almost knightly order of law enforcement.
*   **Section 7** *(Recon)*: Operatives from the SRR and MI6. Section 7 does not officially exist. They prioritize the recovery of Intelligence above all else.

### 🐍 THE SYNDICATE
*An alliance of criminal enterprises and radicals, viewing the collapse as the ultimate opportunity.*

*   **The Firm** *(Brawler)*: The former Oakhaven Cartel. Warlords of the streets who value loyalty and earning power.
*   **The Volunteers** *(Engineer)*: Anti-Crown paramilitaries. Experts in asymmetric warfare, IEDs, and ambushes.
*   **The Meridian Directive** *(Medic)*: The paramilitary wing of the Apex Church. Well-funded fanatics who believe the Collapse is a necessary purging of the "unenlightened".
